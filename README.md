Google firebase auth emulator early access

The firebase cloud sdk consists of serveral parts, for instance firestore emulator, functions emulator and now they release aplpa version of Auth emulator.
By that emulator, we can make our automation testing, unit testing and integration testing, more reliable.

In this repo I am going to try the latest auth emulator to mock a real user then use it in automation testing.
